    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5oz Yeast</li>
        <li>1.5 Cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1.75 Cups Milk</li>
        <li>6oz Butter</li>
        <li>6 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
        <li>2oz Salt</li>
        <li>3lb 9.6oz AP Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve the sugar into the milk and cream and bring the temerature between 95F and 110F. Do not overheat it will kill the yeast.</li>
        <li>Measure the yeast out into a bowl of a large stand mixer and pour over the warm milk.</li>
        <li>Cover this with the flour and poke a small hole in the flour to monitor the yeasts activity.</li>
        <li>Add the salt into a similar indentation, keeping it separated so it doesnt affect the yeast too early.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter but keep it emulsified if possible and within the temperature range that the yeast needs.</li>
        <li>When the yeast is ready and quite active add the eggs and butter.</li>
        <li>Mix the dough on medium-low speed for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and allow to proof until doubled in size, roughly one hour.</li>
        <li>Gently roll the dough into 2oz balls until smooth on top.</li>
        <li>Let rise again until doubled in size</li>
        <li>Bake at 375F for 10 minutes, rotating halfway through.</li>
    </ol>
